# MOPS Wallet Assets Info



## Overview



[MOPS Wallet] uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of other projects.

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _feel free to add your token_.
